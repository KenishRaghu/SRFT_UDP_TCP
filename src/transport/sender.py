    Manages reliable sending of packets using a sliding window protocol.

    1. We can send up to WINDOW_SIZE packets without waiting for ACKs
    2. Each unacknowledged packet has a timer
    3. If timer expires, we retransmit that packet
    4. When we receive an ACK, we slide the window forward
    
    This is similar to TCP's sliding window, but simplified.
